This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from the Practical Machine Learning course, which is a part of the Data Science Specialization. It was written and coded in RStudio, using its knitr functions and published in the html format. The purpose of this analysis is to predict the manner in which the six participants performed the exercises described below and to answer the questions of the associated course quiz. The machine learning algorithm, which uses the classe variable in the training set, is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data. The predictions are submitted to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for grading.
